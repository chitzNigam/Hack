Project Objective: Develop a Distributed Ecosystem of services which surrounds the Storage system, with the data for each of these services being implemented on the Blockchain Infrastructure. 

The scope of this project aims to ensure the following:
            *Immutable Data â€“ Prevents Volatility of value.
            *Transparency
            *Security from Cyberattacks.
            *E2EE
            *Provision of Decentralized Information with Individual participation from all users.
            
Key Points:

            *Usage of Smart Contracts between entities which acts as a public ledger but provide anonymity to the individuals associated with the contract.

            *Usage of Ethereum which decrease the probability of 51% attack significantly.

            *Contract functionality which eases the flow of information between two different contracts/participants.
