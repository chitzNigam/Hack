## Team: Oo_Bhai

***Project Objective:*** <br>
Develop a Distributed Ecosystem of services which surrounds the Storage and Data Sharing system, with the data for each of these services being implemented on the Blockchain Infrastructure. 

***The scope of this project aims to ensure the following:***<br>
1) Immutable Data â€“ Prevents Volatility of value.<br>
2) Transparency<br>
3) Security from Cyberattacks.<br>
4) End-to-end encryption (E2EE)
5) Provision of Decentralized Information with Individual participation from all users.<br>
6) Prevent any misuse of User's data by any corporation or Hackers<br>
            
***Key Points:***<br>
1) Usage of Smart Contracts between entities which acts as a public ledger but provide anonymity to the individuals associated                with the contract.<br>
2) Usage of Ethereum which decrease the probability of 51% attack significantly.<br>
3) Contract functionality which eases the flow of information between two different contracts/participants.
